This framework identifies bottlenecks, measures efficiency, and optimizes the flow of information from raw data to finished intelligence. By mapping complete information paths and measuring timeliness, accuracy, and relevance at each stage, organizations can improve intelligence production processes, reduce delays, and enhance the value delivered to consumers. This framework is essential for intelligence process improvement and optimization initiatives.",
