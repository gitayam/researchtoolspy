    "title": "About ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses)",
    "description": "ACH is a structured analytical technique that helps analysts identify and evaluate alternative explanations (hypotheses) by systematically comparing them against available evidence. It's particularly useful for complex intelligence problems where multiple explanations are possible and evidence is incomplete or ambiguous."
