**Feedback ID**: `5b96c2aa-367a-4d6a-87e3-4a6749616cc2`
**Date**: October 9, 2025

**User Report**:
> "it doesn't populate the frames and gauges. it does give you the SATS (ONLY) and each of them except the BLUF."

**Impact**:
- Framework not generating full output
- Missing frames/gauges visualization
- Missing BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) summary
- Only SATS (Some Aspect of Truth Scale?) working

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Debug deception framework visualization rendering
- [ ] Check BLUF generation logic

- [ ] Test with sample data
- [ ] Update user once fixed

**Files to Check**:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DATA QUALITY ISSUES

### 2. Missing Link Analysis Data
**Priority**: HIGH
**Affected Records**: 135 / 142 (95.1%)

**Details**:
- `links_analysis` field is NULL or empty array for 95% of analyses
- Most analyses were created before links feature was implemented
- No automatic backfill process in place

**Most Duplicated URLs Without Links**:
1. Guardian cyber-attacks article (13 duplicates)
2. Moscow Times militarized economy (10 duplicates)
3. Instagram reel (6 duplicates)
4. Various news articles (2-4 duplicates each)

**Action Required**:
- [x] Add defensive Array.isArray() checks (DONE - commit 500306ec)
- [ ] Create batch backfill script for old analyses
- [ ] Add migration to extract links from existing `extracted_text` field
- [ ] Consider deduplication strategy for repeated URL analyses

### 3. Missing Claim Analysis Data
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Affected Records**: 100 / 142 (70.4%)

**Details**:
- No claim analysis for 100 analyses
- May be intentional (older data before feature)
- Could indicate feature not being used or failing silently

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Check if claim analysis is failing silently
- [ ] Review error logs for claim analysis failures
- [ ] Consider making claim analysis optional vs required
- [ ] Add user preference to enable/disable expensive analyses

### 4. Missing DIME Analysis Data
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Affected Records**: 138 / 142 (97.2%)

**Details**:
- DIME (Diplomatic, Information, Military, Economic) framework analysis missing
- Only 4 analyses have DIME data
- Indicates feature is rarely used or not working

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Review DIME feature adoption
- [ ] Check if DIME analysis is failing
- [ ] Consider making DIME optional/on-demand
- [ ] Add UI toggle for DIME analysis

### 5. Social Media Posts with Zero Word Count
**Priority**: LOW
**Affected Records**: 3+ identified

**Details**:
- Twitter/X posts showing 0 word count
- Examples:
  - @ShelbyTalcott status
  - @DHSgov status
  - @JamesPPinkerton status

**Root Cause**: Social media extraction may not be counting words properly

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Fix word count extraction for social media posts
- [ ] Handle short-form content differently
- [ ] Add special handling for Twitter/X character limit
- [ ] Update word_frequency extraction for social posts

## üßπ MAINTENANCE ISSUES

### 6. Expired Analyses Not Being Cleaned Up
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Records to Delete**: 84

**Details**:
- 84 unsaved analyses past their `expires_at` date

- Auto-cleanup job not running or doesn't exist

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Create Cloudflare Worker cron job for cleanup
- [ ] Schedule daily cleanup at off-peak hours
- [ ] Add logging for cleanup operations
- [ ] Set retention policy (suggest: 7 days for unsaved, unlimited for saved)

**Suggested Cron Job**:
```typescript
// Clean up expired analyses daily at 3 AM UTC
export default {
  scheduled: async (event, env, ctx) => {
    const result = await env.DB.prepare(`
      DELETE FROM content_analysis
      WHERE expires_at < datetime('now')
        AND (is_saved = 0 OR is_saved IS NULL)
    `).run()

    console.log(`Cleaned up ${result.meta.changes} expired analyses`)
  }
}
```

### 7. No Saved Analyses
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Affected Records**: 142 / 142 (100%)

**Details**:
- ALL content analyses are unsaved (is_saved = 0)
- Indicates users are not using the save feature
- Could be UX issue or users don't understand the feature

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Add prominent "Save Analysis" button/prompt
- [ ] Show expiration warning for unsaved analyses
- [ ] Add "Save" tooltip explaining benefits
- [ ] Consider auto-saving frequently accessed analyses
- [ ] Add analytics to track save button clicks

## üìä PERFORMANCE ISSUES

### 8. Variable Processing Times
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Metrics**:
- **Average**: 39.1 seconds per analysis
- **Min**: 2.9 seconds (quick mode)

**Details**:
- Large variance indicates inconsistent performance
- 170s max suggests timeout risk
- Could be related to:
  - External API calls (GPT)
  - Large article sizes
  - Network latency
  - Concurrent processing limits

**Action Required**:
- [ ] Add processing time alerts for >60s analyses
- [ ] Implement timeout at 120s with graceful degradation
- [ ] Add processing time to analytics
- [ ] Optimize expensive operations:
  - Batch GPT calls where possible
  - Cache entity extraction results
  - Stream large text processing
- [ ] Consider background job queue for forensic mode
