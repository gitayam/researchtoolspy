## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Framework pages**: Placeholder UI only, full implementation pending
2. **Store integration**: Using mock data, real Zustand stores in `*_backup` directories
3. **Auto-save**: Not yet implemented
4. **Export functions**: Placeholders only
5. **Research tools**: Not yet migrated
6. **Collaboration**: Not yet migrated
7. **Reports**: Not yet migrated

### Technical Debt
1. `strict: false` in TypeScript config (temporary)
2. Complex libs moved to `lib_backup` (need incremental migration)
3. Full auth store in `stores_backup` (using minimal stub)
4. Framework stores not yet migrated

### No Breaking Issues
- ✅ No build errors
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No runtime errors in console
- ✅ All routes accessible
- ✅ API endpoints working

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Implement one complete framework** (SWOT recommended)
   - Migrate full SWOT page from Next.js
   - Connect to framework store
   - Test create/edit/save/export flow
   
2. **Add Research Tools routes and placeholders**
   - Similar to framework pages approach
   - 7 tool pages to route

3. **Migrate framework store from backup**
   - Move from `stores_backup/frameworks.ts`
   - Fix TypeScript issues
   - Connect to dashboard stats

### Short-term (This Week)
4. Complete 3-5 most-used frameworks (SWOT, ACH, COG, PMESII-PT)
5. Implement auto-save functionality
6. Add Evidence Collector page
7. Add Reports listing page

### Medium-term (Next Week)
8. Complete all 16 frameworks
9. Migrate all research tools
10. Implement export functionality (PDF, Word, Excel, PPT)
11. Add collaboration features
12. Connect to real backend API

### Long-term (Production)
13. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages production
14. Setup CI/CD with GitHub Actions
15. Performance optimization (code splitting)
16. Optional: Migrate to D1 database
17. PWA features (service worker, offline)

## Deployment Readiness

### Ready for Production ✅
- Infrastructure and build system
- Authentication flow
- Dashboard and navigation
- Basic API integration
- Route handling

### Not Ready for Production ⛔
- Framework analysis features (core product)
- Research tools (core product)
- Export functionality (critical feature)
- Collaboration (important feature)
- Full data persistence

### Recommendation
**Status:** Development/Staging Ready  
**Production:** ~2-3 weeks of development remaining

Current deployment is excellent for:
- Internal testing
- Stakeholder demos
- UI/UX review
- Performance baseline
