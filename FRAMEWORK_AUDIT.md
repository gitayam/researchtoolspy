# Framework Implementation Audit Report

## Executive Summary
This audit compares the current implementation against the legacy branch to identify missing frameworks and improvements needed based on Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs) and lessons learned from ACH development.

## Currently Implemented Frameworks (11)

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented with Create/View Pages
1. **ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses)** - Advanced implementation with SATS-based scoring
2. **SWOT Analysis** - Strategic planning framework
3. **COG Analysis** - Center of Gravity analysis
4. **PMESII-PT** - Environmental analysis framework
5. **DIME Analysis** - National power instruments
6. **Starbursting** - Question analysis with 5W framework

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented (Create pages only, missing view pages)
7. **VRIO Framework** - Competitive advantage analysis
8. **PEST Analysis** - Environmental factors analysis
9. **Stakeholder Analysis** - Relationship mapping
10. **Trend Analysis** - Pattern and forecasting
11. **Surveillance Analysis** - Research monitoring

## Missing Frameworks from Legacy Branch (5)

### üî¥ Not Yet Implemented
1. **DOTMLPF-P** (Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, Policy)
   - Military capability assessment framework
   - Essential for defense and organizational analysis
   
2. **Behavior Analysis** (COM-B Model)
   - Capability, Opportunity, Motivation framework
   - Critical for understanding behavioral patterns
   
3. **Deception Detection**
   - Framework for identifying misleading information
   - Important for information warfare and disinformation analysis
   
4. **Fundamental Flow**
   - Causal analysis framework
   - Used for understanding system dynamics
   
5. **Causeway Framework**
   - Cause-effect relationship analysis
   - Important for root cause analysis

## Key Improvements Needed Based on ACH Learnings

### 1. Evidence Quality Assessment
All hypothesis-based frameworks should include:
- 8-point SATS evaluation criteria
- Confidence weighting (logarithmic/linear scales)
- Source credibility ratings
- Evidence diagnosticity metrics

### 2. Export Capabilities
Each framework needs:
- Excel export with structured matrices
- PDF reports with executive summaries
- Word documents for collaboration
- JSON for data interchange

### 3. Structured Analytic Technique Integration
- Add technique snippets explaining methodology
- Include bias mitigation strategies
- Implement hypothesis elimination (not just selection)
- Add confidence levels to conclusions

### 4. Cross-Framework Features
- Evidence library with reuse capabilities
- Tagging system for evidence management
- URL processing and content extraction
- Real-time analysis calculations

## Priority Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Complete Partial Implementations (Q1 2025)
- Add view pages for VRIO, PEST, Stakeholder, Trend, Surveillance
- Implement save/load functionality
- Add basic export capabilities

### Phase 2: Critical Missing Frameworks (Q1-Q2 2025)
1. **DOTMLPF-P** - Essential for military/organizational analysis
2. **Behavior Analysis** - Critical for understanding actors
3. **Deception Detection** - Urgent need for information warfare

### Phase 3: Advanced Frameworks (Q2 2025)
4. **Fundamental Flow** - System dynamics analysis
5. **Causeway** - Root cause analysis

### Phase 4: SATS Enhancement (Q2-Q3 2025)
- Apply evidence evaluation to all frameworks
- Implement cross-framework evidence sharing
- Add advanced export features
- Create framework selection guide

## Technical Debt and Improvements

### From Lessons Learned Document:
1. **Export Functionality**
   - Use ArrayBuffer for browser compatibility
   - Avoid Node.js dependencies (pptxgenjs issue resolved)
   - Implement consistent MIME types

2. **Evidence Management**
   - Rich text editor for evidence entry
   - URL import with metadata extraction
   - Document upload capabilities
   - Evidence versioning and history

3. **Authentication & Security**
   - Hash-based authentication implemented ‚úÖ
   - Need to add framework-level permissions
   - Implement audit logging

4. **UI/UX Consistency**
   - Dark mode support across all frameworks
   - Consistent loading states
   - Error handling patterns
   - Mobile responsiveness

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Sprint)
1. Complete view pages for partially implemented frameworks
2. Add DOTMLPF-P framework (high military value)
3. Implement evidence library foundation

### Short-term (Next 2 Sprints)
1. Add Behavior Analysis and Deception Detection
2. Implement cross-framework evidence sharing
3. Enhance all frameworks with SATS principles

### Long-term (Next Quarter)
1. Complete all missing frameworks
2. Implement AI-assisted analysis
3. Add collaborative features
4. Create comprehensive framework selection guide

## Success Metrics
- All 16 frameworks fully implemented
- 100% feature parity with legacy branch
- Enhanced with SATS methodology
- Professional export capabilities
- Cross-framework evidence sharing
- Consistent UI/UX across all frameworks

## Conclusion
The platform currently has 11 of 16 frameworks, with 6 fully functional and 5 partially implemented. The missing frameworks are critical for comprehensive analysis capabilities, particularly in military and behavioral domains. Applying lessons from ACH development will ensure all frameworks meet professional standards for structured analytic techniques.
