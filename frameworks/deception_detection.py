    **Deception Detection** helps analysts determine when to look for deception, discover whether 
    deception is present, and figure out what to do to avoid being deceived. This framework uses 
    four key checklists: MOM, POP, MOSES, and EVE.
    
    As Richards J. Heuer Jr. noted: *"The accurate perception of deception in counterintelligence 
    analysis is extraordinarily difficult. If deception is done well, the analyst should not expect 
    to see any evidence of it. If, on the other hand, deception is expected, the analyst often 
    will find evidence of deception even when it is not there."*
