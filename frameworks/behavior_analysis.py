            **Purpose**  
            To build upon the latest doctrine TM 3-53.11 Influence Process Activity: Target Audience Analysis Chapter 2 by providing a more in-depth analysis of a specific behavior in a particular area.  
            This analysis produces a shared understanding of the behavior and the relevant actors, locations, obstacles, symbols, etc.  
            It is not limited to a MISO analysis onlyâ€”it may include insights that benefit other units operating in the area.

            **How To Use Template**  
            1. Replace all placeholders (e.g., BEHAVIOR_HERE, COUNTRY_HERE) with your specific information.  
            2. Fill in the fields below with your observations and data.  
            3. Use the provided buttons to generate questions, get answer suggestions, and finally generate a report.

            **Additional Considerations**"""
