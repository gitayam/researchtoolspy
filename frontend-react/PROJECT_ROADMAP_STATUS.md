## üìã Remaining Work

### Phase 3.6: Complete Form/View i18n (DEFERRED)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Estimated Time**: 5-7 days (systematic multi-session work)
**Complexity**: HIGH - ~4,000 lines of code across 6 components

**Components to Internationalize**:
- [ ] COGForm.tsx (~1,150 lines) - Primary analysis form
- [ ] COGView.tsx (~700 lines) - Analysis detail view
- [ ] COGWizard.tsx (~1,100 lines) - Step-by-step wizard
- [ ] COGVulnerabilityMatrix.tsx (~450 lines) - Vulnerability comparison
- [ ] COGQuickScore.tsx (~280 lines) - Rapid scoring dialog
- [ ] AICOGAssistant.tsx (~670 lines) - AI assistance UI

**Estimated Extraction**:
- ~800-1,000 unique English strings
- ~200-300 translation keys needed
- Forms have nested structures with tooltips, help text, validation messages

**Systematic Approach**:
1. **Day 1-2**: COGForm.tsx + COGView.tsx (largest components)
2. **Day 3**: COGWizard.tsx
3. **Day 4**: COGVulnerabilityMatrix.tsx + COGQuickScore.tsx
4. **Day 5**: AICOGAssistant.tsx
5. **Day 6-7**: Testing, QA, Spanish review

**Why Defer**:
- Phase 2.5 AI integration provides higher immediate value
- Export components (PowerPoint, Excel, PDF) already internationalized
- Coalition operations can use English UI with Spanish exports
- Best done systematically over multiple focused sessions

**Alternative Quick Win**: Internationalize only the most-used component (COGWizard.tsx) first - Est: 1-2 days

#### 4.2 Assignment & Ownership (Est: 2-3 days)
- [ ] Assign COGs to team members (J2, J3, J5, etc.)
- [ ] Task tracking
- [ ] Team view dashboard
- [ ] Workload visualization

#### 4.3 Approval Workflow (Est: 3-4 days)
- [ ] Draft ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Published states
- [ ] Reviewer assignment
- [ ] Change tracking
- [ ] Version history

#### 4.4 Time-Phased Analysis (Est: 2-3 days)

- AI assistance now available in BOTH Wizard and advanced Form
- Complete AI coverage for all user workflows
- ~$0.01 per analysis cost remains unchanged

### Option 1: Quick Win - Internationalize COGWizard Only ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
**Why**: Most-used component, highest ROI for i18n
**Time**: 1-2 days
**Impact**: Wizard usable in Spanish (80% of users)
**Benefit**: Coalition operations with Spanish-speaking allies
**Defer**: Form/View i18n can wait (used by 20% of advanced users)

### Option 2: Complete Phase 3.6 (Full Form/View i18n)
**Why**: Finish all multi-language support
**Time**: 5-7 days (systematic multi-session work)
**Impact**: Full Spanish support across all 6 components
**Note**: Large undertaking - best done over multiple sessions
**Use Cases**:
- Coalition operations requiring Spanish UI everywhere
- Latin American capacity building programs
- Interagency coordination with Spanish-speaking agencies

### Option 3: Start Phase 4.1 (Comments System)

**Time**: 2-3 days
**Impact**: Multi-analyst COG development
**Features**:
- Threaded comments on COGs/capabilities/requirements/vulnerabilities
- @mentions for team members
- Resolve/unresolve workflow
**Use Cases**:
- Staff sections collaborating on COG analysis (J2, J3, J5)
- Peer review before commander briefing
- Tracking feedback from operational planning teams

### Option 4: Performance & Polish
**Why**: Optimize user experience
**Time**: 2-3 days
**Examples**:

## üêõ Known Issues & Bugs

### Instagram Extraction Failures (ACTIVE)
**Reported**: 2025-10-06
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: Investigating

**Symptom**: "Instagram post could not be extracted. The post may be private, deleted, or you may need to try again later."

**Current Implementation**:
- Uses cobalt.tools API for extraction (external service)
- Has retry logic (2 attempts, 1s delay)
- Caching enabled (1 hour TTL)
- Code: `functions/api/content-intelligence/social-media-extract.ts:490-602`

**Potential Causes**:
1. **Instagram API Changes**: Instagram frequently updates anti-scraping measures
2. **cobalt.tools Rate Limiting**: External service may be rate-limited
3. **Private/Deleted Posts**: Legitimate failures for inaccessible content
4. **Cloudflare Workers IP Blocking**: Instagram may block CF edge IPs

**Recommended Fixes** (in priority order):

**Option 1: Multiple Fallback Services** ‚≠ê (1-2 days)
- Add fallback to alternative services when cobalt.tools fails
- Services to try: instaloader, instadp, snapinsta
- Sequential fallback chain with timeout
- **Impact**: 80%+ success rate via service diversity

**Option 2: Instagram oEmbed API** (1 day)
- Use official Instagram oEmbed API for metadata
- Doesn't provide download URLs but gets post info
- Limitation: embed-only, no media download
- **Impact**: Reliable for public posts, limited functionality

**Option 3: User Upload Workflow** (2-3 days)
- When extraction fails, offer "Upload Manually" option
- User downloads via Instagram app ‚Üí uploads to tool
- Store in R2 with post metadata
- **Impact**: Always works, requires user action

**Option 4: Browser Extension** (1-2 weeks)
- Create browser extension for one-click extraction
- Extension has user's Instagram cookies/auth
- Bypasses IP blocking issues
- **Impact**: Best user experience, more complex deployment

**Quick Fix** (TODAY): Improve error messages
- Show specific failure reason (rate limit vs private vs blocked)
- Provide "Try again in X minutes" countdown
- Add "Report Issue" button with URL for debugging
- Suggest manual download + upload workflow

**Related Files**:
- `functions/api/content-intelligence/social-media-extract.ts` (main extraction)
- `src/pages/tools/ContentIntelligencePage.tsx` (UI)
