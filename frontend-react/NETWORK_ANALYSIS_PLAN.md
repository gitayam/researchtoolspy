**Created:** October 3, 2025
**Status:** Planning & Design
**Priority:** High - Core Intelligence Capability

---

## üéØ Requirements Analysis

### Core Requirements
1. **Universal Entity Linking** - Connect any entity to any other entity

   - Node rendering:
     - Color by entity type
     - Size by centrality/importance
     - Icons for entity types
     - Labels on hover
   - Edge rendering:
     - Color by relationship type
     - Thickness by weight
     - Style by confidence (solid/dashed)
     - Directional arrows
   - Interactions:
     - Zoom/pan
     - Click to select
     - Drag nodes
     - Right-click for context menu

3. **Network Filters**
   - Entity type filter (show/hide actors, events, etc.)
   - Relationship type filter
   - Confidence threshold
   - Date range filter
   - Depth of connections (1-hop, 2-hop, etc.)

### Phase 3: Export Functionality (4-6 hours)
**Goal:** Export network data for external analysis

**Export Formats:**

1. **Edge List CSV**
   ```csv
   source_id,source_type,target_id,target_type,relationship_type,weight,confidence,start_date,end_date
   actor_123,ACTOR,event_456,EVENT,PARTICIPATED_IN,0.9,CONFIRMED,2024-01-01,2024-01-15
   ```

2. **Node List CSV**

   actor_123,ACTOR,John Smith,Military,0.75,HIGH
   event_456,EVENT,Operation Blue Sky,OPERATION,N/A,CRITICAL
   ```

3. **JSON Graph**
   ```json
   {
     "nodes": [
       {"id": "actor_123", "type": "ACTOR", "label": "John Smith", "metadata": {...}}
     ],
     "edges": [
       {"source": "actor_123", "target": "event_456", "type": "PARTICIPATED_IN", "weight": 0.9}
     ]
   }
   ```

   - Degree centrality (# of connections)
   - Betweenness centrality (bridge nodes)
   - Closeness centrality (avg distance to all nodes)
   - Eigenvector centrality (importance based on neighbors)
   - PageRank (Google's algorithm)

2. **Network-Level Metrics**
   - Number of nodes/edges
   - Network density
   - Average clustering coefficient
   - Number of communities/clusters
   - Average path length
   - Network diameter

3. **Path Analysis**
   - Shortest path between two entities
   - All paths within N hops
   - Critical paths (highest weighted path)

**UI Components:**
- `NetworkMetricsPanel` - Display calculated metrics
- `PathFinderDialog` - Find paths between entities
- `CentralityRanking` - Top nodes by centrality
- Metric visualization (histograms, distributions)

### Phase 5: Framework Integration (8-10 hours)
**Goal:** Connect entity network with COG and Causeway frameworks

**COG Integration:**

Current COG structure:
```typescript
interface COGAnalysis {
  critical_capabilities: Array<{name, description, assessment}>
  critical_requirements: Array<{name, description, assessment}>
  critical_vulnerabilities: Array<{name, description, assessment}>
}
```

**Enhancement:**
```typescript
interface COGElement {
  name: string
  description: string
  assessment: string
  linked_entities: string[]  // Entity IDs
  entity_type: EntityType
}
```

**Features:**
- Map COG elements to entities (Actor, Place, System)
- Show COG network (capabilities ‚Üí requirements ‚Üí vulnerabilities)
- Highlight critical nodes in main network
- Export COG-specific subgraph

**Causeway Integration:**

Current Causeway structure:
```typescript
interface CausewayRow {
  action: string
  actor: string
  target: string
  means: string
  when: string
  // ... other columns
}
```

**Enhancement:**
- Each row becomes a set of entities + relationships
- Action ‚Üí Event entity
- Actor ‚Üí Actor entity
- Target ‚Üí Actor/Place entity
- Relationships: PERFORMED, TARGETED, USED_MEANS
- Visualize causal chain as directed graph
- Path analysis shows cause-effect sequences

**Implementation:**
1. Add `linked_entity_id` field to COG/Causeway elements
2. Entity selector in COG/Causeway forms
3. "View Network" button in COG/Causeway views
4. Network graph filtered to show COG/Causeway subgraph
