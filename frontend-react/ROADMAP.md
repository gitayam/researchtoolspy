### Sentiment Analysis Broken
**Status**: Broken
**Priority**: HIGH
**Issue**: Sentiment analysis not working or returning errors
**Root Causes to Investigate**:
- [ ] GPT API integration issues
- [ ] JSON parsing failures
- [ ] Missing or malformed sentiment_analysis field in database
- [ ] Frontend rendering errors

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Debug backend sentiment analysis endpoint
- [ ] Check GPT prompt and response format
- [ ] Validate database schema for sentiment_analysis column
- [ ] Add error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Test with sample articles
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed analyses

**Estimated Effort**: 6 hours

---

### Claims Analysis Broken
**Status**: Broken
**Priority**: HIGH
**Issue**: Claim detection and deception analysis not functioning
**Root Causes to Investigate**:
- [ ] GPT API failures
- [ ] claim_analysis field not saving to database
- [ ] Frontend parsing errors
- [ ] Empty or null responses from analysis

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Debug backend claim analysis endpoint
- [ ] Fix GPT prompt for claim extraction
- [ ] Validate deception risk scoring logic
- [ ] Add comprehensive error logging
- [ ] Test with controversial content
- [ ] Add manual claim entry fallback

**Estimated Effort**: 6 hours

---

### Progressive Loading UX Improvement
**Status**: Enhancement
**Priority**: HIGH
**Issue**: All-or-nothing loading bar creates poor UX, users wait for everything before seeing anything
**Solution**:
- [ ] **Phase 1: Show Summary First** (Fastest to display)
  - Extract and display summary within 2-3 seconds
  - Show skeleton loaders for other sections
  - Allow user to read summary while other analysis runs

- [ ] **Phase 2: Progressive Component Loading**
  - Load in priority order:
    1. Summary (immediate)
    2. Word frequency (fast, no GPT)
    3. Entities (moderate, spaCy/NER)
    4. Sentiment (slower, GPT)
    5. Claims (slower, GPT)
    6. DIME (on-demand only)
    7. Starbursting (on-demand only)

- [ ] **Phase 3: Independent Analysis States**
  - Each component has own loading state
  - Failed components don't block others
  - Retry buttons for failed sections
  - Cache successful analyses

- [ ] **Phase 4: Background Analysis**
  - Start word/entity analysis immediately
  - Queue GPT analyses (sentiment, claims) as background jobs
  - Use WebSocket or polling to update UI when ready
  - Show progress notifications

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// New loading states
interface AnalysisProgress {
  summary: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
  wordFrequency: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
  entities: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
  sentiment: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
  claims: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
  dime: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
  starbursting: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
}

// API changes
POST /api/content-intelligence/analyze
â†’ Returns basic metadata + summary immediately
â†’ Starts background jobs for other analyses
â†’ Returns job IDs for polling

GET /api/content-intelligence/status/:analysisId
â†’ Returns completion status for each component
â†’ Frontend polls this every 2 seconds
```

**Estimated Effort**: 12 hours

## Priority 2: PMESII-PT Framework Enhancements ðŸŸ¢

### Phase 1: URL Import Integration
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED (Deployed 2025-10-10)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Added "Import Sources" card to PMESII-PT create page
- [x] Created URL input with "Analyze URL" button
- [x] Implemented loading state during analysis
- [x] Display imported sources as removable badges
- [x] Integrated with Content Intelligence analyze endpoint
- [x] Also available for DIME, DOTMLPF, PEST frameworks

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/frameworks/GenericFrameworkForm.tsx`

---

### Phase 2: Backend API for URLâ†’PMESII-PT Mapping
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED (Deployed 2025-10-10)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Created `/api/frameworks/pmesii-pt/import-url` endpoint
- [x] Integrated Content Intelligence analysis
- [x] GPT-4o-mini powered mapping to 8 PMESII-PT dimensions
- [x] Auto-generates 2-3 Q&A pairs per dimension
- [x] Returns structured PMESII-PT data

**Dimension Mapping Implemented**:
```typescript
Political: Government, leaders, political actors, governance
Military: Armed forces, defense capabilities, security
Economic: Trade, GDP, financial entities, resources
Social: Demographics, culture, education (uses summary)
Information: Media landscape, propaganda (future)
Infrastructure: Transportation, facilities, locations
Physical: Geography, terrain, environmental factors
Time: Dates, historical context, temporal patterns
```

**File Created**: `functions/api/frameworks/pmesii-pt/import-url.ts`

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Dimension Pre-Population
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED (Built into Phase 2)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
