### Sentiment Analysis Broken
**Status**: Broken
**Priority**: HIGH
**Issue**: Sentiment analysis not working or returning errors
**Root Causes to Investigate**:
- [ ] GPT API integration issues
- [ ] JSON parsing failures
- [ ] Missing or malformed sentiment_analysis field in database
- [ ] Frontend rendering errors

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Debug backend sentiment analysis endpoint
- [ ] Check GPT prompt and response format
- [ ] Validate database schema for sentiment_analysis column
- [ ] Add error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Test with sample articles
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed analyses

**Estimated Effort**: 6 hours

---

### Claims Analysis Broken
**Status**: Broken
**Priority**: HIGH
**Issue**: Claim detection and deception analysis not functioning
**Root Causes to Investigate**:
- [ ] GPT API failures
- [ ] claim_analysis field not saving to database
- [ ] Frontend parsing errors
- [ ] Empty or null responses from analysis

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Debug backend claim analysis endpoint
- [ ] Fix GPT prompt for claim extraction
- [ ] Validate deception risk scoring logic
- [ ] Add comprehensive error logging
- [ ] Test with controversial content
- [ ] Add manual claim entry fallback

**Estimated Effort**: 6 hours

---

### Progressive Loading UX Improvement
**Status**: Enhancement
**Priority**: HIGH
**Issue**: All-or-nothing loading bar creates poor UX, users wait for everything before seeing anything
**Solution**:
- [ ] **Phase 1: Show Summary First** (Fastest to display)
  - Extract and display summary within 2-3 seconds
  - Show skeleton loaders for other sections
  - Allow user to read summary while other analysis runs

- [ ] **Phase 2: Progressive Component Loading**
  - Load in priority order:
    1. Summary (immediate)
    2. Word frequency (fast, no GPT)
    3. Entities (moderate, spaCy/NER)
    4. Sentiment (slower, GPT)
    5. Claims (slower, GPT)
    6. DIME (on-demand only)
    7. Starbursting (on-demand only)

- [ ] **Phase 3: Independent Analysis States**
  - Each component has own loading state
  - Failed components don't block others
  - Retry buttons for failed sections
  - Cache successful analyses

- [ ] **Phase 4: Background Analysis**
  - Start word/entity analysis immediately
  - Queue GPT analyses (sentiment, claims) as background jobs
  - Use WebSocket or polling to update UI when ready
  - Show progress notifications

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// New loading states
interface AnalysisProgress {
  summary: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
  wordFrequency: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
  entities: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
  sentiment: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
  claims: 'pending' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
  dime: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
  starbursting: 'idle' | 'loading' | 'complete' | 'error'
}

// API changes
POST /api/content-intelligence/analyze
â†’ Returns basic metadata + summary immediately
â†’ Starts background jobs for other analyses
â†’ Returns job IDs for polling

GET /api/content-intelligence/status/:analysisId
â†’ Returns completion status for each component
â†’ Frontend polls this every 2 seconds
```

**Estimated Effort**: 12 hours

### Phase 2: Backend API for URLâ†’PMESII-PT Mapping
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED (Deployed 2025-10-10)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Created `/api/frameworks/pmesii-pt/import-url` endpoint
- [x] Integrated Content Intelligence analysis
- [x] GPT-4o-mini powered mapping to 8 PMESII-PT dimensions
- [x] Auto-generates 2-3 Q&A pairs per dimension
- [x] Returns structured PMESII-PT data

**Dimension Mapping Implemented**:
```typescript
Political: Government, leaders, political actors, governance
Military: Armed forces, defense capabilities, security
Economic: Trade, GDP, financial entities, resources
Social: Demographics, culture, education (uses summary)
Information: Media landscape, propaganda (future)
Infrastructure: Transportation, facilities, locations
Physical: Geography, terrain, environmental factors
Time: Dates, historical context, temporal patterns
```

**File Created**: `functions/api/frameworks/pmesii-pt/import-url.ts`

---

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Dimension Pre-Population

**Note**: This was implemented directly in the import-url endpoint using GPT-4o-mini rather than as separate UI buttons. More efficient approach.

---

### Phase 4: Geographic Context & Evidence Integration
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Issue**: PMESII-PT is fundamentally geographic but lacks location context

**Requirements**:
- [ ] **Location Selector**: Add country, state/region, city fields to PMESII-PT
  - Required field: At minimum country
  - Optional: State/region, city for more specificity
  - Auto-suggest locations (use existing location entities)
  - Display location prominently in analysis header

- [ ] **Evidence Integration**: Transform PMESII-PT into evidence library
  - Each Q&A item should link to evidence
  - Tag evidence with:
    - Location (country, region, city)
    - PMESII-PT dimension (Political, Military, etc.)
    - Source URL
    - Date/temporal context
  - Create "PMESII Evidence Library" page showing all evidence by dimension and location

- [ ] **Framework Integration**: Feed PMESII evidence into ACH and other frameworks

  - Filter evidence by location and dimension
  - Cross-reference evidence across frameworks

**Estimated Effort**: 12 hours

   - Import from saved Content Intelligence analyses
   - Manual entry

3. **Step 3: Dimension Analysis** (8 tabs)
   - Political â†’ Military â†’ Economic â†’ Social â†’ Information â†’ Infrastructure â†’ Physical â†’ Time
   - AI suggestions for each dimension
   - Evidence linking per item
   - Progress indicator showing completed dimensions

4. **Step 4: Review & Export**
   - Summary view across all dimensions
   - Identify gaps (dimensions with no data)
   - AI-generated executive summary
   - Export options (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, JSON, CSV)
   - Generate shareable link

**Files to Create**:
- `src/components/frameworks/PMESIIPTWizard.tsx`

  - Handles mislabeled or ambiguous sections

**Libraries Needed**:
- `mammoth` or `docx` for DOCX parsing
- `pptxgenjs` or custom parser for PPTX

**API Endpoints**:
- `/api/frameworks/pmesii-pt/import-pptx`
- `/api/frameworks/pmesii-pt/import-docx`

**Estimated Effort**: 14 hours
