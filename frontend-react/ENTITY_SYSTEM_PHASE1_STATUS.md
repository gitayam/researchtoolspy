## Deception Detection Integration

### Actor → MOM-POP

**Motive, Opportunity, Means (MOM)**:
- `motive`: 0-5 scale - Why would they deceive?
- `opportunity`: 0-5 scale - Can they control information?
- `means`: 0-5 scale - Do they have capabilities?

**Patterns of Practice (POP)**:
- `historical_pattern`: 0-5 scale - Past deception frequency
- `sophistication_level`: 0-5 scale - Deception complexity
- `success_rate`: 0-5 scale - Historical success

**Storage**: JSON in `actors.deception_profile` column

**Example**:
```json
{
  "mom": {
    "motive": 5,
    "opportunity": 4,
    "means": 5,
    "notes": "High strategic incentive to deceive..."
  },
  "pop": {
    "historical_pattern": 5,
    "sophistication_level": 5,
    "success_rate": 4,
    "notes": "Documented deception history..."
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "overallLikelihood": 85,
    "riskLevel": "HIGH",
    "confidenceLevel": "HIGH"
  },
  "last_updated": "2025-10-03T..."
}
```

### Source → MOSES

**My Own Sources Evaluation (MOSES)**:
- `source_vulnerability`: 0-5 scale - Can source be compromised?
- `manipulation_evidence`: 0-5 scale - Signs of manipulation?
- `access_level`: EXCLUSIVE | LIMITED | SHARED | OPEN
- `reliability`: A (completely reliable) → F (unreliable)

**Storage**: JSON in `sources.moses_assessment` column

**Example**:
```json
{
  "source_vulnerability": 3,
  "manipulation_evidence": 2,
  "access_level": "LIMITED",
  "reliability": "B",
  "notes": "Source has contact with adversary-controlled individuals..."
}
```

### Evidence → EVE (Ready, Not Implemented)

**Evaluation of Evidence (EVE)**:
- `internal_consistency`: 0-5 (INVERTED - low = high risk)
- `external_corroboration`: 0-5 (INVERTED - low = high risk)
- `anomaly_detection`: 0-5 (high = high risk)

**Storage**: Ready in schema, needs API implementation
