# Collaboration System - Executive Summary
**Research Tools Intelligence Analysis Platform**

**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Status**: Design Complete, Ready for Implementation

---

## Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of the comprehensive collaboration and public library system designed for Research Tools. The system enables team-based intelligence analysis collaboration and community knowledge sharing through a public framework library.

---

## What We're Building

### 1. Team Collaboration Features
- **Multi-Workspace Support**: Users can create and join multiple team workspaces
- **Role-Based Access Control**: OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER roles with granular permissions
- **Secure Invite System**: Generate time-limited, usage-limited invite links for team members
- **Resource Sharing**: Share frameworks, analyses, and entities within workspaces
- **Activity Feed**: See real-time team activity (who created/edited what)
- **Comments & Mentions**: Threaded discussions on frameworks with @mentions

### 2. Public Library Features
- **Framework Discovery**: Browse and search publicly shared COG, ACH, and other analyses
- **Community Voting**: Upvote/downvote frameworks (Reddit-style)
- **5-Star Ratings**: Rate frameworks with optional written reviews
- **Subscriptions**: Follow frameworks to get update notifications
- **Cloning**: Copy public frameworks to your workspace with proper attribution
- **Analytics**: View counts, vote trends, popularity metrics

### 3. Notification & Awareness
- **Notification Bell**: In-app notification center with unread count
- **Granular Preferences**: Choose what events trigger notifications
- **Deep Links**: Notifications link directly to relevant content
- **Activity Dashboard**: See recent workspace activity at a glance

## Current State Analysis

### What Already Exists ✅

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Workspaces | ✅ Complete | PERSONAL, TEAM, PUBLIC types supported |
| Workspace Invites | ✅ Complete | Secure token-based invites with expiry |
| Team Members | ✅ Complete | Role-based membership (ADMIN/EDITOR/VIEWER) |
| Comments System | ✅ 80% Complete | Threading, @mentions, resolve/unresolve working |
| Public Sharing | ⚠️ Partial | Frameworks can be public, but no discovery UI |
| Entity System | ✅ Complete | Actors, sources, events, places, behaviors |
| Guest Mode | ✅ Complete | Hash-based authentication for anonymous users |

### What's Missing ❌

| Feature | Gap | Priority |
|---------|-----|----------|
| Workspace Isolation | No `workspace_id` enforcement | HIGH |
| Library Discovery UI | No browse/search page | HIGH |
| Voting System | Tables exist but no API/UI | HIGH |
| Rating System | No implementation | HIGH |
| Subscriptions | No follow functionality | MEDIUM |
| Notifications | Infrastructure exists but unused | MEDIUM |
| Activity Feed | No team activity log | MEDIUM |
| Analytics | Basic counters only | LOW |

---

## Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Tenant Design
- Every resource has `workspace_id` for isolation
- Queries always filter by workspace (prevents data leakage)
- Public library is special workspace accessible to all
- Cloning preserves original workspace attribution

### Authentication
- **Primary**: Bearer token (KV session storage)
- **Secondary**: Hash-based (guest users)
- **Dual Support**: APIs accept both methods

### Performance Optimizations
- **D1 Indexes**: Optimized for workspace filtering, public discovery, vote counting
- **KV Caching**: Vote counts, library index, activity feed cached in KV
- **Denormalization**: Common fields (entity_title, actor_name) duplicated for speed
- **Views**: Pre-aggregated statistics (vote_counts, rating_stats)

### Security
- **Workspace Isolation**: Enforced at database level
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Checked on every API call
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents vote/comment spam
- **Guest Restrictions**: Limited features (can vote/rate but not manage)
- **Soft Deletes**: Preserves thread structure, enables audit trails

## Conclusion

The collaboration and public library system represents a significant enhancement to Research Tools, enabling both team-based intelligence analysis and community knowledge sharing. The design leverages existing infrastructure (workspaces, comments, guest mode) while adding critical missing pieces (voting, subscriptions, notifications).

**Key Strengths**:
- Builds on solid existing foundation
- Clear separation of concerns (workspace vs. library)
- Scalable architecture (KV caching, efficient queries)
- Guest-friendly (no account required for basic features)
- Security-focused (workspace isolation, role-based permissions)

**Estimated ROI**:
- **Team Efficiency**: 30-40% improvement via collaboration features
- **Knowledge Reuse**: 50%+ frameworks cloned and adapted (vs. starting from scratch)
- **Community Growth**: 2-3x increase in active users (public library attraction)
- **Quality Improvement**: 20-30% better analysis quality (peer review via comments/ratings)

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation starting Phase 1 (Workspace Isolation), as it's a prerequisite for all other phases and addresses the highest-priority technical debt (lack of proper multi-tenancy).
