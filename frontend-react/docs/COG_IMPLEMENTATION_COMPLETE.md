## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The Center of Gravity (COG) Analysis framework has been fully implemented with all requested features, including guided workflow, scoring systems, network analysis, and evidence integration.

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Complete Type System** (`/src/types/cog-analysis.ts`)

**Hierarchical Data Structure:**
```
COG Analysis
  ├── Operational Context (guided questions)
  ├── Centers of Gravity (DIMEFIL domains)
  │   └── Critical Capabilities (verbs)
  │       └── Critical Requirements (nouns)
  │           └── Critical Vulnerabilities (scored)
  │
  └── Network Analysis (edge list + centrality)
```

**Key Types:**
- `COGAnalysis` - Complete analysis container
- `OperationalContext` - Guided operational questions
- `CenterOfGravity` - COG entities with actor/domain classification
- `CriticalCapability` - What the COG can DO (action-oriented)
- `CriticalRequirement` - What's NEEDED (resource-oriented)
- `CriticalVulnerability` - Weaknesses with scoring

**Actor Categories:**
- Friendly Forces
- Adversary
- Host Nation
- Third Party

**DIMEFIL Domains:**
- Diplomatic 🤝
- Information 📡
- Military 🎖️
- Economic 💰

    └─⚡ Capability: Influence Public Opinion
       └─📋 Requirement: Social Media Platforms
          └─⚠️ Vulnerability: Platform Policy (Score: 21, Rank #1)
  ```
- Click to expand/collapse
- Color-coded by entity type

### 4. **Network Analysis Functions** (`/src/types/cog-analysis.ts`)

**Implemented:**
```typescript
generateEdgeList(analysis: COGAnalysis): NetworkEdge[]
// Creates edges: COG→Capability→Requirement→Vulnerability

calculateCentralityMeasures(edges: NetworkEdge[]): CentralityMeasures
// Computes: degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality

rankVulnerabilitiesByScore(vulnerabilities): CriticalVulnerability[]
// Sorts by composite score and assigns priority ranks

calculateCompositeScore(scoring: ScoringCriteria): number
// Computes I + A + F
```

## 📊 Example Workflow

### Scenario: Analyzing Adversary Information Operations

**Step 1: Context**
```
Title: Adversary IO COG Analysis
Objective: Identify and prioritize adversary information vulnerabilities
Timeframe: Q1 2025
Strategic Level: Operational
```

**Step 2: Identify COG**
```
Actor: Adversary
Domain: Information
Description: Adversary's propaganda and disinformation network
Rationale: Primary means of influencing target populations
```

**Step 3: Map Capabilities**
```
Capability: Influence Public Opinion
Description: Shape narrative through coordinated messaging
Strategic Contribution: Undermines support for opposing forces
```

**Step 4: Identify Requirements**
```
Requirement: Social Media Platforms
Type: Infrastructure
Description: Access to major social platforms for message dissemination
```

**Step 5: Find Vulnerabilities**
```
Vulnerability: Platform Policy Enforcement
Type: Cyber
Description: Platforms can detect and remove coordinated inauthentic behavior

Scoring (Logarithmic):
  Impact on COG: 8 (Major impairment)
  Attainability: 5 (Moderate effort - platforms already have tools)
  Follow-up: 8 (Significant cascading effects - forces adversary to new tactics)
  Composite Score: 21

Priority Rank: #1 (highest)
```

**Step 6: Network Analysis**
```
Generated Edge List:
  adversary-info-cog → influence-capability (enables)
  influence-capability → social-platforms-req (requires)
  social-platforms-req → platform-policy-vuln (exposes, weight: 21)

Centrality:
  platform-policy-vuln: Highest betweenness centrality (critical node)
```

**Step 7: Export**
- Edge list CSV for network visualization
- Full report for briefing
- Vulnerabilities CSV for prioritization matrix

## 🔗 Integration Points

### 1. Evidence System
Every COG entity can link to evidence:
```typescript
// In COG Form
<Button onClick={() => openEvidenceLinker('vulnerability', vulnId)}>
  Link Evidence ({vuln.linked_evidence.length})
</Button>
```

### 2. Network Graph (Future)
Ready for integration with existing NetworkGraphCanvas:
```typescript
import { generateEdgeList, calculateCentralityMeasures } from '@/types/cog-analysis'

const edges = generateEdgeList(cogAnalysis)
const centrality = calculateCentralityMeasures(edges)

<NetworkGraphCanvas
  nodes={convertToNodes(cogAnalysis)}
  links={edges}
  highlightMetric="betweenness_centrality"
/>
```

### 3. Entity System (Future)
COGs can reference actors:
```typescript
interface CenterOfGravity {
  actor_id?: string  // Link to Actor entity
  actor_name?: string
  // ...
}
```

### Scoring Guide
**Linear (1-5):**
