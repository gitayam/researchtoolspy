# COG Implementation - Staff Planner Review & Pain Points

## 🎭 Perspective: Military/Intelligence Staff Planner

As a staff planner conducting COG analysis for operational planning, here's my experience using the tool:

---

## 🔴 Critical Pain Points

### 1. **Too Much Clicking - Workflow Inefficiency**

**Problem:**
```
To score ONE vulnerability, I have to:
1. Click to expand COG (1 click)
2. Click to expand Capability (1 click)
3. Click to expand Requirement (1 click)
4. Adjust 3 sliders (3 interactions)
Total: 6+ interactions for ONE vulnerability
```

**Impact:**
- Analyzing 20 vulnerabilities = 120+ clicks
- Lose context switching between levels
- Can't see the big picture
- Tedious and error-prone

**Solution Needed:**
- Flat vulnerability scorecard view
- Bulk editing capabilities
- Quick-score mode

---

### 2. **No Guidance During COG Identification**

**Problem:**
The tool asks "What's your COG?" but doesn't help me answer:
- How do I know if this is REALLY a COG vs just important?
- How many COGs should I identify? (1? 5? 20?)
- Should I identify friendly AND adversary COGs?
- What if I'm analyzing at multiple levels (tactical, operational, strategic)?

**Current State:**
```
Just a blank form that says:
"Actor Category: [dropdown]"
"Domain: [dropdown]"
"Description: [text]"
```

**What I Need:**
```
Guided wizard that asks:
- "Who/what are you analyzing?" (friendly forces, adversary, specific organization)
- "At what level?" (tactical, operational, strategic)
- "What's the objective?" (to protect our COG? exploit theirs?)
- "Let's test if this is a COG..." (validation questions)
```

**Solution Needed:**
- COG Identification Wizard
- Validation checklist ("If you neutralized this, would the actor collapse?")
- Examples/templates
- Warning if too many/too few COGs

---

### 3. **Confusion Between Capabilities and Requirements**

**Problem:**
The labels "Capabilities (verbs)" and "Requirements (nouns)" are too academic.

**Staff Planner Reality:**
- "Wait, is 'logistics support' a capability or requirement?"
- "Is 'trained personnel' what they CAN do or what they NEED?"
- Constant confusion about which layer to use

**Current Guidance:**
```
Capability: "verb/action"
Requirement: "noun/resource"
```

**What Actually Helps:**
```
Critical Capability: "What can the COG DO?"
  Example: "Launch coordinated missile strikes"

Critical Requirement: "What does that capability NEED to work?"
  Example: "Command and control network"

Critical Vulnerability: "What's the WEAKNESS in that requirement?"
  Example: "Single headquarters building"
```

**Solution Needed:**
- Better labels with questions
- Examples next to each field
- Validation (warn if capability looks like a noun)
- Templates with pre-filled examples

---

### 4. **Scoring Happens Too Late**

**Problem:**
I build the entire COG structure, THEN score vulnerabilities at the end.

**Staff Planner Reality:**
- I want to score as I go
- I want to see which COG is most critical WHILE building
- I want to focus effort on high-value analysis

**Current Workflow:**
```
1. Identify all COGs (could be 5+)
2. Map all capabilities (could be 20+)
3. Map all requirements (could be 40+)
4. Finally score vulnerabilities
5. Discover the most critical ones are in a COG I barely analyzed
```

**Better Workflow:**
```
1. Identify COG candidates
2. Quick-score them (which is most critical?)
3. Deep-dive on top 2-3 COGs
4. Map capabilities
5. Score vulnerabilities as you go
6. See real-time prioritization
```

**Solution Needed:**
- COG priority scoring
- Progressive disclosure (don't show all at once)
- "Focus mode" on one COG at a time
- Real-time vulnerability ranking across ALL COGs

---

### 5. **No "So What?" - Missing Action Recommendations**

**Problem:**
I can identify vulnerabilities and score them, but then what?

**Current Output:**
```
Vulnerability: "Platform Policy Enforcement"
Score: 21 (Rank #1)
```

**What I Actually Need:**
```
Vulnerability: "Platform Policy Enforcement"
Score: 21 (Rank #1)
So What: "If exploited, adversary loses primary influence mechanism"
Recommended Actions:
  - Report disinformation to platforms
  - Work with platforms on coordinated takedowns
  - Monitor for adversary adaptation
Effect on Friendly COA: Enables information dominance
```

**Solution Needed:**
- "Recommended Actions" field per vulnerability
- "Expected Effect" field
- Link to Courses of Action (COAs)
- "Targeting packet" export

---

### 6. **Can't Compare Vulnerabilities Across COGs**

**Problem:**
Vulnerabilities are buried in hierarchy. Can't easily compare:
- "Which is more critical: Adversary's logistics hub or their C2 node?"
- "Should I focus on Friendly protection or Adversary exploitation?"

**Current View:**
```
COG 1: Adversary Military
  └─ Capability: Project Power
     └─ Requirement: Logistics
        └─ Vuln: Single supply route (Score: 18)

COG 2: Adversary Information
  └─ Capability: Influence
     └─ Requirement: Platforms
        └─ Vuln: Platform policy (Score: 21)
```

I have to manually remember scores and compare.

**Solution Needed:**
- **Vulnerability Matrix View** showing ALL vulnerabilities across ALL COGs
- Filter by actor (show only Adversary vulnerabilities)
- Filter by domain (show only Information vulnerabilities)
- Visual heat map
- Export to targeting matrix

---

### 7. **Missing Templates and Examples**

**Problem:**
Blank canvas is intimidating. No idea if I'm doing it right.

**What I Want:**
```
Templates:
- "Adversary Command & Control COG"
- "Friendly Logistics COG"
- "Information Operations COG"
- "Cyberspace COG"

Each with:
- Pre-filled COG description
- Example capabilities
- Example requirements
- Example vulnerabilities
- Typical scores
```

**Solution Needed:**
- Template library
- "Start from template" button
- "Clone from previous analysis" option
- Worked examples in help

---

### 8. **No Collaboration Features**

**Problem:**
COG analysis is a TEAM effort (J2, J3, J5, J6 all contribute).

**Current State:**
- One person owns the analysis
- No way to assign sections to team members
- No comments or discussion
- No review/approval workflow

**What I Need:**
```
- Assign COG to J3, capabilities to J2
- Comment on vulnerabilities: "I disagree with this score because..."
- Track who made changes and when
- Submit for review → approve → publish
- Version history
```

**Solution Needed:**
- Comments on any entity
- Assignment/ownership
- Change tracking
- Approval workflow
- Team view showing who's working on what

---

### 9. **No Network Visualization** (Currently Placeholder)

**Problem:**
The "Network" tab just says "visualization requires integration."

**Staff Planner Need:**
This is CRITICAL for briefing commanders. I need to show:
- Which vulnerabilities are connected
- Which COG is most central to the enemy system
- Cascading effects of exploiting vulnerability X
- Alternative pathways if primary approach is blocked

**Solution Needed:**
- Actual network graph visualization
- Interactive (click node to see details)
- Highlight paths
- Simulate "What if we neutralize this?"
- Export as PNG/SVG for briefing slides

---

### 10. **Export Formats Don't Match Staff Products**

**Problem:**
Current exports:
- Edge list CSV (for data scientists, not useful for staff)
- Markdown report (not formatted for military products)
- Vulnerabilities CSV (close, but not quite right)

**What I Actually Need:**
```
- PowerPoint slide deck with:
  * Title slide with analysis metadata
  * Operational context slide
  * COG summary by actor
  * Vulnerability matrix (table format)
  * Network diagram
  * Recommendations slide

- Excel targeting matrix:
  * Vulnerability | COG | Score | Recommended Action | Assigned To | Status

- PDF appendix for OPORD:
  * Formal COG analysis section
  * Properly formatted IAW JP 5-0

- Word document for staff estimates
```

**Solution Needed:**
- PowerPoint export
- Excel targeting matrix
- PDF report formatted IAW military standards
- Customizable templates

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 11. **No Confidence Ratings**

I might be 90% confident about one COG, 40% confident about another.
- Need confidence slider per COG
- Need to show assumptions vs facts
- Need to mark "requires further analysis"

### 12. **Can't Link to Intelligence Products**

My COG analysis should reference:
- IPB products (MCOO, event templates)
- Intelligence reports (SITREPs, INTSUMs)
- PIRs/IRs that drove the analysis

Need: Evidence linking (exists) + PIR/IR linking + IPB product references

### 13. **No Time-Phased Analysis**

COGs change over time:
- Day 1: Enemy COG is air defense
- Day 7: Enemy COG is will to fight
- Day 30: Enemy COG is logistics

Need: Multiple snapshots or time-phased COG tracking

### 14. **No Integration with Courses of Action**

COG analysis should inform COAs, but there's no connection.

Need: "This vulnerability supports COA 2" linking

### 15. **Scoring Descriptors Are Too Generic**

"Impact on COG: 8 - Major impairment" doesn't help me understand WHAT the impact is.

Better: "Impact: If exploited, adversary loses 70% of strike capability within 48 hours"

---

## 🟢 Nice to Have (Future)

### 16. **AI Assistance**

- "Suggest capabilities for this COG"
- "Analyze my vulnerabilities for gaps"
- "Compare to historical COG analyses"

### 17. **Red Team Mode**

- Switch view to adversary perspective
- "If I were the enemy, how would I protect this COG?"
- Automated OPSEC check

### 18. **Integration with Other Tools**

- Import from PMESII-PT analysis
- Export to targeting tools
- Sync with Common Operational Picture (COP)

## 🔧 Specific UI Improvements Needed

### Better Operational Context Questions

**Current:**
```
Objective: [text box]
```

**Improved:**
```
🎯 What is your analysis objective?
Examples:
  • Identify adversary vulnerabilities for targeting
  • Protect friendly COGs from adversary action
  • Assess host nation critical infrastructure

[text box with placeholder examples]

💡 Tip: A good objective is specific, measurable, and tied to commander's intent
```

### Better COG Form

**Current:**
```
Description: [empty text box]
Rationale: [empty text box]
```

**Improved:**
```
📝 Describe this Center of Gravity
What is it? [text]

✅ COG Validation Checklist:
☐ If neutralized, would this critically degrade the actor's ability to achieve objectives?
☐ Is this truly a source of power (not just important)?
☐ Is this at the right level of analysis (tactical/operational/strategic)?

💡 Example: "Adversary's integrated air defense system provides freedom of maneuver
and protects critical infrastructure across the theater."

🤔 Why is this a COG? (Rationale)
[text box]

💡 Example: "Without air defense, adversary loses sanctuary for ground forces,
logistics hubs, and C2 nodes. Historical analysis shows air dominance correlates
with 85% success rate in similar conflicts."
```

### Better Scoring Interface

**Current:**
```
Impact (I): [slider 1-5]
Negligible impact
```

**Improved:**
```
🎯 Impact on COG (I)
If this vulnerability is exploited, what happens to the COG?

[slider 1-12]

12 ━━━━━━●━━━━━━ 12 - CRITICAL FAILURE
     "COG collapses within 24-48 hours"

What specifically happens?
[text box for detailed impact description]

Example: "Air defense system loses 70% effectiveness. Enemy gains air superiority
within 72 hours, enabling close air support and interdiction operations."
```

## 💡 Key Insights from Staff Planner Perspective

1. **Speed matters** - Staff planners are under time pressure. Every extra click is painful.

2. **Templates are essential** - No one wants to start from scratch. Give me 80% of the work done.

3. **Comparison is critical** - I need to compare options to make recommendations.

4. **Briefing is the deliverable** - The tool should export directly to briefing formats.

5. **Collaboration is reality** - COG analysis is never solo work.

6. **"So what?" is mandatory** - Identifying vulnerabilities without recommended actions is incomplete.

7. **Confidence matters** - I need to distinguish between "I'm sure" and "I think maybe".

8. **Examples teach** - Show me what good looks like.

9. **Validation prevents errors** - Guide me to correct analysis, don't just accept any input.

10. **Visualization sells** - Commanders want to SEE the analysis, not read it.

---

**Bottom Line:**
The current implementation has solid foundations but needs **usability improvements** for real-world staff use. Focus on: templates, comparison views, guided workflows, and briefing-ready exports.
