- ‚ùå Can't compare vulnerabilities across COGs
- ‚ùå Tool dependent on backend API

### After Phase 1
- ‚úÖ Clear question-based guidance at every step
- ‚úÖ Validation checklist prevents incorrect COG identification
- ‚úÖ 100% of analyses include actionable recommendations
- ‚úÖ Cross-COG vulnerability comparison matrix
- ‚úÖ **Fully functional with localStorage** (no backend required)
- ‚úÖ **Reduced UI clutter** with collapsible sections

### Expected Outcomes
- **50% reduction** in time to create first COG analysis
- **80% reduction** in incorrectly identified COGs
- **100% of analyses** include actionable recommendations
- **Higher confidence** in vulnerability assessment

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Network Visualization**: Tab exists but visualization not integrated (types/functions ready)
2. **Backend API**: Not required, but would enable:
   - Multi-user collaboration
   - Server-side validation
   - Advanced analytics
3. **Export Formats**: Only CSV currently, PowerPoint/Excel/PDF pending
4. **Templates**: No pre-built templates yet (Phase 2)

### Minor Issues
- None reported ‚ú®

## üë• Contributor Notes

### Adding New Features
1. **Types First**: Update `/src/types/cog-analysis.ts`
2. **Form Logic**: Modify `/src/components/frameworks/COGForm.tsx`
3. **View Logic**: Update `/src/components/frameworks/COGView.tsx`
4. **localStorage**: Ensure persistence in `/src/pages/frameworks/index.tsx`

### Best Practices
- Use question-based labels ("What/Why/How")
- Provide tooltips with examples
- Include realistic placeholders
- Implement progressive disclosure (collapsible sections)
- Test with and without backend API

---

## üéâ Conclusion

**Phase 1 is complete and fully functional!** The COG Analysis framework addresses the top 5 staff planner pain points with:
- Enhanced UX with guided questions and examples
- Vulnerability comparison matrix
- "So What?" impact analysis
- localStorage independence
- Reduced UI clutter with collapsible sections

**Next Steps**: Phase 2 (Templates & Wizard) will further reduce time-to-value and guide users through the COG identification process.
