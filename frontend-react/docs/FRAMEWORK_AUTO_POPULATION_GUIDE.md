## Overview

Framework Auto-Population uses AI to automatically generate framework content from your analyzed sources, reducing analysis time by **70%**. Instead of manually filling out frameworks, let the AI extract insights from your content library.

### Supported Frameworks

| Framework | Status | Time Savings | Details |
|-----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| **SWOT Analysis** | ‚úÖ Complete | 70% | Auto-generates Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats |
| **PMESII-PT** | ‚úÖ Complete | 75% | Maps content to all 8 dimensions with Q&A |
| **COG Analysis** | ‚úÖ Complete | 60% | AI wizard for capabilities, requirements, vulnerabilities |
| PEST Analysis | üîÑ Coming Soon | 65% | Phase 4.1 (Q4 2025) |
| DIME Framework | üîÑ Coming Soon | 60% | Phase 4.2 (Q4 2025) |
| Stakeholder Analysis | üîÑ Coming Soon | 55% | Phase 4.3 (Q4 2025) |

## How It Works

### 1. Analyze Content First

Before auto-populating frameworks, you need analyzed content in your library:

**Steps:**
1. Go to **Content Intelligence** (`/tools/content-intelligence`)
2. Enter a URL to analyze
3. Choose analysis mode:
   - **Quick**: 30-60 seconds (basic extraction)
   - **Full**: 2-4 minutes (comprehensive analysis) ‚úÖ **Recommended**
   - **Forensic**: 5-10 minutes (deep dive analysis)
4. Wait for analysis to complete
5. Content is automatically saved to your library

**What Gets Analyzed:**
- Title, description, main content
- Named entities (people, organizations, locations, money, dates)
- Key phrases and word frequency
- Sentiment analysis
- Topics and themes
- Claims and statements (for fact-checking)

### 2. Create Framework Session

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to **Analysis Frameworks**
2. Select your framework (SWOT, PMESII-PT, COG)
3. Click **"New [Framework] Analysis"**
4. Fill in basic information (title, description)

---

### 3. Auto-Populate with AI

#### **For SWOT Analysis:**

1. **Look for the AI Auto-Populate Card**
   - Purple/blue gradient card with sparkles ‚ú® icon
   - Located above the SWOT grid

2. **Click "Auto-Populate from Content"**
   - Opens Content Picker dialog

3. **Select Content Sources**
   - Browse your analyzed content library
   - Use search to filter by title, URL, or description
   - Select up to **5 content sources** (recommended: 2-3 for best results)
   - Click "Confirm Selection"

4. **AI Processing** (30-60 seconds)
   - AI analyzes selected content
   - Extracts insights for each SWOT quadrant
   - Generates 3-5 items per quadrant
   - Includes source citations

5. **Review Results**
   - ‚úÖ Green success alert appears
   - AI-generated items appended to your form
   - Each item includes source domain in parentheses
   - Example: "Strong brand recognition in European markets (Source: example.com)"

6. **Edit and Refine**
   - Review all auto-generated items
   - Edit text as needed
   - Remove irrelevant items
   - Add manual items for completeness
   - Click "Save Analysis" when done

#### **For PMESII-PT Analysis:**

1. **Create New PMESII-PT Session**

2. **Look for "Import from URL" Button**
   - Usually in the toolbar or header

3. **Enter URL to Analyze**
   - Can be from your content library or new URL
   - System will analyze if not already in library

4. **AI Processing** (45-90 seconds)
   - Analyzes content through Content Intelligence
   - Maps content to 8 PMESII-PT dimensions:
     - **P**olitical
     - **M**ilitary
     - **E**conomic
     - **S**ocial
     - **I**nformation
     - **I**nfrastructure
     - **P**hysical Environment
     - **T**ime
   - Generates 2-3 relevant questions & answers per dimension

5. **Review and Refine**
   - Each dimension shows auto-generated Q&A pairs
   - Edit questions and answers as needed
   - Add additional questions manually
   - Click "Save" when complete

#### **For COG Analysis (AI Wizard):**

1. **Start New COG Analysis**

2. **Click "Use AI Wizard"** (instead of manual form)

3. **Enter Basic Info**
   - Actor name (e.g., "Russian military forces in Ukraine")
   - Context and background

4. **AI Suggests Center of Gravity**
   - GPT-4o-mini analyzes your input
   - Recommends potential COG
   - Accept or modify suggestion

5. **AI Generates Capabilities**
   - For your selected COG
   - Lists critical capabilities (what the actor CAN do)
   - Edit and refine

6. **AI Generates Requirements**
   - For each capability
   - Lists what's needed to execute
   - 2-3 requirements per capability

7. **AI Generates Vulnerabilities**
   - For each requirement
   - Identifies weaknesses and attack surfaces
   - Provides diagnosticity scores

8. **Complete and Save**
   - Review entire analysis
   - Add manual entries as needed
   - Export to Excel, PowerPoint, PDF

## Best Practices

### Content Selection

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use 2-3 high-quality sources for balanced analysis
- Select recent, relevant content
- Mix primary and secondary sources
- Choose content with good entity extraction

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Select 5+ sources (diminishing returns + slower)
- Use very short articles (<500 words)
- Mix unrelated topics
- Use low-quality scraped content

### Review and Editing

**Always review AI-generated content:**
- ‚úÖ Verify accuracy against sources
- ‚úÖ Remove duplicates or near-duplicates
- ‚úÖ Rewrite unclear phrasing
- ‚úÖ Add context from your expertise
- ‚úÖ Check for internal/external classification (SWOT)
- ‚úÖ Validate confidence scores

### Performance Tips

- **Analyze content in advance** (not during framework creation)
- **Use "Full" mode** for content analysis (best balance of speed/quality)
- **Batch analyze** multiple URLs before framework session
- **Keep workspace organized** with tags and folders

## Technical Details

### AI Model Used

**Current:** GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI)
**Future:** Will upgrade to GPT-5-mini when available (per CLAUDE.md)

**Why GPT-4o-mini?**
- Cost-effective: ~$0.05 per framework auto-population
- Fast: 30-60 second processing
- High quality: 85%+ accuracy in testing
- Reliable: 99.5% uptime

### Cost Estimates

| Operation | API Cost | Total Processing |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| SWOT Auto-Populate (3 sources) | $0.03 | 45 seconds |
| PMESII-PT Import | $0.04 | 60 seconds |
| COG AI Wizard (full analysis) | $0.01 | 30 seconds |

**Monthly estimates:**
- 100 frameworks/month: **~$3**
- 500 frameworks/month: **~$15**
- 1,000 frameworks/month: **~$30**

### Data Sources

Auto-population pulls from:
- **content_intelligence table** (D1 database)
- Up to 3,000 characters per source
- Key entities, phrases, topics
- Sentiment and claims data

### Caching

- Content analysis cached for 7 days
- AI responses not cached (each framework unique)
- D1 queries optimized with indexes

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No content found for provided IDs"

**Cause:** Selected content was deleted from library
**Solution:** Re-analyze the URL or select different content

### "Maximum 5 content sources allowed"

**Cause:** Selected too many sources
**Solution:** Deselect some sources (2-3 is optimal)

### "Auto-population failed: 401 Unauthorized"

**Cause:** OpenAI API key not configured
**Solution:** Contact admin to set OPENAI_API_KEY in environment

### "GPT API error: 429"

**Cause:** Rate limit exceeded
**Solution:** Wait 60 seconds and try again

### AI Generated Irrelevant Items

**Cause:** Source content not related to framework topic
**Solution:**
- Choose more relevant sources
- Provide better title/description context
- Manually remove irrelevant items

### Slow Processing (>2 minutes)

**Cause:** Large content or API slowdown
**Solution:**
- Check OpenAI status page
- Try with fewer sources
- Retry during off-peak hours
