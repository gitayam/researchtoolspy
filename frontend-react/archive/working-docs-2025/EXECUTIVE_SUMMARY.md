# Executive Summary: Content-First Architecture Shift

**Project:** ResearchTools Intelligence Platform Architecture Redesign
**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Prepared By:** Technical Research & Due Diligence Team
**Status:** Implementation Plan - Awaiting Approval

---

## The Problem

The ResearchTools platform currently treats **Content Intelligence as a buried tool** (at `/dashboard/tools/content-intelligence`) rather than the foundational entry point. Users must navigate deep into the dashboard to analyze URLs, creating friction in the most common workflow: analyzing external intelligence sources.

**Current Flow:** User → Login → Dashboard → Tools → Content Intelligence → URL Analysis → Manual Framework Creation

**Desired Flow:** User → Landing Page → URL Analysis → Auto-Suggested Frameworks → Pre-Populated Analysis

This inverted hierarchy makes content the foundation upon which all framework analysis builds, transforming the platform from a "framework tool with optional content" to a "content intelligence platform with framework automation."

---

## The Solution

### 1. Landing Page as Primary Entry Point

**Change:** Move URL input field to the landing page hero section. Allow non-authenticated users to immediately analyze URLs using a bookmark hash system.

**Impact:**
- Reduces friction from "5 clicks to analyze" to "1 click to analyze"
- Enables viral growth (users can share analysis results via bookmark hash)
- Captures intent immediately (analyze first, authenticate later)

**Complexity:** LOW (3-5 days)

---

### 2. Persistent Content Storage with Workspace Isolation

**Change:** Add `workspace_id` to `content_analysis` and `saved_links` tables. Implement content hash deduplication. Store entities as relational links (not just JSON blobs).

**Impact:**
- Multi-tenancy enforced (users cannot see each other's content)
- Deduplication saves database space (same article analyzed 100 times = 1 storage)
- Entities become queryable ("show all frameworks mentioning Putin")

**Complexity:** MEDIUM (5-8 days)

**Database Schema Changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE content_analysis ADD COLUMN workspace_id TEXT;
CREATE TABLE content_entities (content_id, entity_id, entity_type, mention_count);
CREATE TABLE framework_content_sources (framework_id, content_id, field_mappings);
CREATE TABLE content_deduplication (content_hash, canonical_content_id);
```

---

### 3. AI-Powered Framework Suggestions

**Change:** After analyzing content, GPT-5-mini evaluates which frameworks are most applicable (PMESII-PT, DIME, COG, etc.) and suggests top 3 with confidence scores.

**Impact:**
- Users discover frameworks they didn't know existed
- Reduces "blank canvas" paralysis (AI guides user to best tool)
- Increases framework creation rate (conversion from content → framework)

**Complexity:** HIGH (6-9 days)

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {"framework_type": "pmesii-pt", "confidence": 0.92, "reasoning": "Political, military, economic analysis detected"},
    {"framework_type": "dime", "confidence": 0.85, "reasoning": "Diplomatic, information, military, economic dimensions present"},
    {"framework_type": "cog", "confidence": 0.78, "reasoning": "Critical capabilities and vulnerabilities identified"}
  ]
}
```

**Cost:** ~$0.02 per analysis (GPT-5-mini at $0.25/1M input tokens)

---

### 4. Framework Auto-Population

**Change:** When user selects a suggested framework, GPT pre-populates fields from content (e.g., PMESII-PT: extract political paragraphs → populate "Political" field). User reviews/edits before saving.

**Impact:**
- 10x faster framework creation (from 30 min manual entry → 3 min review/edit)
- Consistent field population (AI follows strict rubric)
- Traceability (each field links back to source paragraphs)

**Complexity:** VERY HIGH (10-14 days)

**Auto-Population Logic:**
```typescript
PMESII-PT: {
  political: "Extract paragraphs mentioning government, policy, law, diplomacy",
  military: "Extract mentions of forces, capabilities, operations, equipment",
  economic: "Extract trade, markets, sanctions, GDP, inflation",
  // ... 8 categories total
}

DIME: {
  diplomatic: "Extract diplomatic relations, treaties, alliances",
  information: "Extract propaganda, media, narratives",
  military: "Extract operations, posture, capabilities",
  economic: "Extract sanctions, trade, financial warfare"
}
```

**Cost:** ~$0.10 per auto-population (larger prompt, more processing)

---

### 5. Bidirectional Content Linking

**Change:** Track which content informed which frameworks/evidence. From content view, see "Used in 3 frameworks, cited in 5 evidence items." From framework view, see "Populated from 2 content sources."

**Impact:**
- Provenance transparency (every claim traceable to source)
- Content reuse visibility (identify most valuable sources)
- Stale data alerts ("Framework uses 90-day-old content, re-analyze?")

**Complexity:** MEDIUM (5-7 days)

**Junction Tables:**
- `framework_content_sources`: Links frameworks to source content
- `content_entities`: Links content to extracted actors/places/events
- `evidence_items.source_content_id`: Links evidence to source content

---

## Business Impact

### User Acquisition
- **Non-authenticated users can try platform immediately** → Lower barrier to entry
- **Bookmark hash enables viral sharing** → "Check out this analysis I created"
- **Landing page becomes marketing tool** → SEO optimized for "analyze intelligence sources"

### User Retention
- **Framework suggestions reduce friction** → Users discover tools they need
- **Auto-population saves time** → 10x faster workflow = higher engagement
- **Content traceability builds trust** → "This analysis is backed by 3 sources"

### Operational Efficiency
- **Content deduplication reduces database usage** → Same article analyzed 100x = 1 storage
- **Framework auto-population reduces manual work** → 30 min → 3 min per framework
- **Entity extraction automation** → Manually creating 50 actors → 1-click batch import

---

## Cost Analysis

### Infrastructure Costs

**Current State:**
- Database: Free (Cloudflare D1 free tier: 100K rows/day)
- Workers: Free (Cloudflare Pages Functions: 100K requests/day)
- No AI costs (no GPT integration yet)

**After Implementation:**
- Database: Same (deduplication keeps row count manageable)
- Workers: Same (within free tier limits)
- **GPT API: $200-400/month** (assuming 100 analyses/day with suggestions + auto-population)
  - Framework suggestions: 100/day × $0.02 = $2/day = $60/month
  - Auto-population: 50/day × $0.10 = $5/day = $150/month
  - Buffer for retries, variations: ~$100/month
  - **Total: ~$300/month GPT costs**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement suggestion caching (cache hit rate 40% → reduce GPT calls by 40%)
- Make auto-population opt-in (not automatic for every analysis)
- Use GPT-5-nano for simpler tasks (4x cheaper than GPT-5-mini)
- Set monthly budget limit ($300) with alerts at 80%

## Recommendation

**PROCEED with phased implementation.**

**Priority Phases:**

2. Phase 3 (Suggestions) - **HIGH** - Immediate user value, differentiator
3. Phase 4 (Auto-Population) - **VERY HIGH** - Core value proposition

**Optional/Future Phases:**
- Phase 2 (Landing Page) - Nice-to-have, can be partially deployed early
- Phase 5 (Bidirectional Linking) - Quality-of-life improvement
- Phase 6 (Entity Automation) - Advanced feature for power users

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **GPT cost containment** - Monitor closely, implement caching aggressively
2. **Auto-population accuracy** - User trust depends on AI quality, mark fields as "review required"
3. **Workspace migration reliability** - Users must not lose data during registration
4. **Database size management** - Deduplication must work, monitor database growth

**Go/No-Go Decision Point:** End of Phase 1
- If database migrations fail or performance degrades → Pause, reassess
- If bookmark hash system works and deduplication achieves >30% cache hit rate → Proceed to Phase 3
