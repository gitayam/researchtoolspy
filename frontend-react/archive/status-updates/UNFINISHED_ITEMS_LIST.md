### ü§ñ AI & Batch Processing (1 item)

  - Currently processes items one-by-one

### üé≠ Actor & Event Deception (3 items)

- **Line 71**: Batch load entity names
  - Entity names loaded individually, should batch

- **Line 417**: Open MOM assessment creation modal
  - Button exists but modal not implemented

- **Line 421**: Open MOM assessment edit modal
  - Edit button exists but modal not implemented

#### src/components/entities/EventDetailView.tsx
- **Line 446**: Open MOM assessment creation modal with event pre-selected
  - Create button exists but modal not wired up

- **Line 460**: Open MOM assessment creation modal with event pre-selected
  - Duplicate of above, needs consolidation

- **Line 464**: Open MOM assessment edit modal
  - Edit button not functional

#### src/components/entities/MOMAssessmentForm.tsx
- **Line 51**: Fetch actors and events from API
  - Actor/event dropdowns use placeholder data

### üîê Authentication (1 item)

#### src/stores/auth.ts
- **Line 21**: Implement actual login
  - Currently placeholder, uses hash-based auth bypass

### üìù Framework Implementation Note (1 item)

#### src/utils/framework-relationships.ts
- **Line 146**: Would need to create/link action as an EVENT entity
  - Note about future entity creation for Causeway framework

## üéØ Priority Assessment

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED (10 items resolved!)

1. ‚úÖ **Evidence Linking API Integration** (8 items) - **COMPLETE**
   - All evidence linking TODOs resolved
   - DeceptionView and GenericFrameworkView fully integrated
   - COG/Causeway relationship extraction foundation laid

2. ‚úÖ **Network Graph Enhancements** (2 items) - **COMPLETE**
   - Entity names now fetched from API with batched calls
   - Path highlighting fully functional with golden visual theme

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY (Remaining features)

1. **MOM Assessment Modals** (3 items)
   - Blocks deception analysis from Actor/Event pages
   - UI buttons exist but modals not wired up
   - Est. time: 3-4 hours

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (UX improvements)

2. **Batch AI Processing** (1 item)
   - Performance improvement for bulk operations
   - Est. time: 2-3 hours

3. **Batch Entity Name Loading** (1 item)
   - Actor detail view loads entity names individually
   - Should use batched API calls
   - Est. time: 1-2 hours

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY (Nice-to-haves)

4. **Deferred Items** (3 items)
   - Relationship auto-generation (requires entity linking)
   - Sharing functionality (requires collaboration API - Phase 4)
   - Network graph refresh (will resolve with entity linking)

5. **Authentication System** (1 item)
   - Currently using hash-based workaround
   - Low priority unless multi-user needed
   - Est. time: 8-12 hours

- **Completed:** 10 items ‚úÖ
- **Remaining:** 8 items
- **Completion Rate:** 56% ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

**Breakdown:**

## üîÑ Next Actions

### ‚úÖ Sprint 1: Evidence Linking System (Oct 4) - **COMPLETE**
- ‚úÖ All 8 evidence linking TODOs resolved
- ‚úÖ API integration complete (GET, POST, DELETE)
- ‚úÖ Foundation for COG/Causeway relationships laid

### ‚úÖ Sprint 2: Network Graph Enhancements (Oct 4) - **COMPLETE**
- ‚úÖ Entity name fetching from API
- ‚úÖ Path highlighting with golden visual theme

### Sprint 3: MOM Assessment Modals (Next)
**Goal:** Wire up MOM assessment modals from Actor/Event pages

**Tasks:**
1. Create or update MOM assessment modal component
   - Form for creating new MOM assessments
   - Pre-populate with actor/event context
   - Wire up to Actor detail view (line 417, 421)
   - Wire up to Event detail view (line 446, 460, 464)

2. Consolidate duplicate modal triggers
   - EventDetailView has duplicate "create" buttons (line 446, 460)
   - Needs consolidation

3. Fetch actors/events for dropdowns
   - MOMAssessmentForm.tsx line 51
   - Replace placeholder data with API calls

**Success Criteria:**
- MOM assessment can be created from Actor page
- MOM assessment can be edited from Actor page
- MOM assessment can be created from Event page with event pre-selected
- MOM assessment can be edited from Event page
- No duplicate functionality or buttons

## üìù Technical Debt Notes

### Code Quality Issues
- **Duplicate TODOs**: Lines 446 and 460 in EventDetailView.tsx
- **Missing error handling**: Evidence linking has no error boundaries
- **No loading states**: Link/unlink operations need spinners
- **Type inconsistencies**: Some entity IDs are strings, others numbers

### Performance Concerns
- **N+1 queries**: Entity names loaded one-by-one (line 71, ActorDetailView)
- **No caching**: Evidence links re-fetched on every render
- **Bundle size**: Evidence components not code-split
