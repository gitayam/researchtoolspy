## Lessons from Free Tier

### What We Learned
1. **10ms CPU limit** was main constraint for AI features
2. **1 build slot** slowed down development velocity
3. **3 day logs** made debugging harder
4. **Free tier was sufficient** for basic operations

### Why Upgrade Makes Sense
1. **Enables core features:** Auto-population and advanced analysis
2. **Removes bottlenecks:** 15min vs 10ms is game-changing
3. **Improves DX:** 6 concurrent builds speeds up development
4. **Cost-effective:** $5/month for massive capability increase
5. **Growth ready:** Pay-as-you-go scales with usage
