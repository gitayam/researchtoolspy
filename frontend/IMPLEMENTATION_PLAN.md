# Frontend Implementation Plan - API Security Hardening

## Evidence-Based Analysis Framework Pattern

Based on research from other branches, particularly the deception detection and ACH frameworks, each security analysis should include comprehensive evidence collection and structured questioning.

## Core Security Questions Framework

### 1. Threat Assessment Questions
- What are the specific attack vectors targeting our API endpoints?
- What evidence do we have of current or attempted security breaches?
- What are the most valuable assets accessible through our API?
- How sophisticated are the potential attackers (script kiddies vs. nation-state)?
- What is the current threat landscape for similar applications?

### 2. Vulnerability Evidence Collection
- What security testing has been performed on our API endpoints?
- What dependencies have known vulnerabilities?
- What authentication/authorization gaps exist?
- What input validation weaknesses are present?
- What logging and monitoring blind spots exist?

### 3. Risk Impact Analysis Questions
- What would be the business impact of a successful API breach?
- What sensitive data could be exposed through API vulnerabilities?
- What regulatory compliance issues would arise from a breach?
- What reputational damage could occur?
- What operational disruption would result?

### 4. Mitigation Evidence Requirements
- What security controls are currently implemented?
- What industry best practices are we following?
- What security frameworks (OWASP, NIST) guide our implementation?
- What third-party security tools are integrated?
- What incident response procedures are in place?

## Implementation Steps with Evidence Collection

### Phase 1: Security Assessment Evidence Gathering
1. **API Endpoint Inventory**
   - Document all API endpoints with their security requirements
   - Evidence: endpoint documentation, OpenAPI specs, route definitions
   - Questions: Which endpoints handle sensitive data? Which are public vs authenticated?

2. **Authentication Flow Analysis**
   - Map current authentication mechanisms
   - Evidence: auth flow diagrams, token validation code, session management
   - Questions: Are tokens properly validated? Is session management secure?

3. **Input Validation Review**
   - Audit all input validation mechanisms
   - Evidence: validation schemas, sanitization functions, error handling
   - Questions: Are all inputs properly validated? What bypass opportunities exist?

### Phase 2: Security Hardening Implementation
1. **Rate Limiting Implementation**
   - Evidence: current traffic patterns, abuse detection logs
   - Questions: What are normal vs. suspicious request patterns?
   - Implementation: Redis-based rate limiting with configurable thresholds

2. **Enhanced Authentication Security**
   - Evidence: current auth implementation, security audit results
   - Questions: Are we following OAuth2/OIDC best practices?
   - Implementation: JWT validation, refresh token rotation, MFA support

3. **API Security Headers**
   - Evidence: current header configuration, security scanner results
   - Questions: Which security headers are missing or misconfigured?
   - Implementation: CORS, CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options configuration

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Detection
1. **Security Event Logging**
   - Evidence: current logging coverage, incident response requirements
   - Questions: What security events are we missing? How quickly can we detect attacks?
   - Implementation: Structured security logging with correlation IDs

2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Evidence: baseline traffic patterns, known attack signatures
   - Questions: What constitutes normal vs. suspicious behavior?
   - Implementation: ML-based anomaly detection for API usage patterns

## Evidence Collection Templates

### Security Incident Evidence Template
```json
{
  "incident_type": "api_security_event",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-XX",
  "evidence_sources": [
    {
      "type": "log_entry",
      "source": "api_gateway",
      "content": "...",
      "reliability": "high"
    },
    {
      "type": "network_capture",
      "source": "packet_analysis",
      "content": "...",
      "reliability": "high"
    }
  ],
  "impact_assessment": {
    "data_accessed": "none|limited|significant|critical",
    "systems_affected": ["api", "database", "auth"],
    "business_impact": "low|medium|high|critical"
  }
}
```

### Vulnerability Assessment Evidence Template
```json
{
  "vulnerability_id": "VULN-2025-001",
  "cve_references": ["CVE-2025-XXXX"],
  "evidence_type": "security_scan|penetration_test|code_review",
  "affected_components": ["endpoint", "dependency", "configuration"],
  "severity": "low|medium|high|critical",
  "exploit_evidence": {
    "proof_of_concept": "...",
    "attack_vectors": ["..."],
    "prerequisites": ["..."]
  },
  "remediation_evidence": {
    "patch_available": true|false,
    "workaround_available": true|false,
    "vendor_response": "..."
  }
}
```

## Integration with Existing Framework Pattern

Following the patterns from deception_detection.py and ach.py:

### Question-Driven Analysis
Each security assessment should include:
- Structured questions for each security domain
- AI-assisted answer suggestions
- Evidence linking for each response
- Export capabilities for security reports

### Evidence Integration
- Each security finding should be backed by specific evidence
- Evidence should be categorized by reliability (SATS methodology)
- Cross-reference evidence across different security frameworks
- Track evidence sources and chain of custody

### Export and Reporting
- JSON export for security analysis data
- DOCX export for executive security reports
- Excel export for vulnerability tracking matrices
- Integration with existing export_to_docx utilities

## Security-Specific UI Components

### Security Dashboard Cards
Following the card pattern from other frameworks:
```typescript
const SecurityCard = ({ title, severity, evidence_count, last_updated }) => (
  <Card className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 border-l-4 border-red-500">
    <CardContent>
      <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">{title}</h3>
        <Badge variant={severity}>{severity}</Badge>
      </div>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        {evidence_count} pieces of evidence â€¢ Updated {last_updated}
      </p>
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
)
```

### Evidence Collection Forms
Following the question pattern from deception detection:
```typescript
const SecurityQuestionForm = ({ question, category, onResponse }) => (
  <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg border">
    <h4 className="text-red-500 font-medium mb-2">{question}</h4>
    <textarea 
      className="w-full p-3 border rounded-md"
      placeholder="Provide evidence and analysis..."
      onChange={(e) => onResponse(category, e.target.value)}
    />
    <div className="mt-2 flex justify-between">
      <Button variant="outline" size="sm">AI Suggestion</Button>
      <Button variant="outline" size="sm">Search Evidence</Button>
    </div>
  </div>
)
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the security question framework in the current branch
2. Add evidence collection templates to the frontend
3. Create security-specific UI components following the established patterns
4. Integrate with the backend security hardening APIs
5. Add comprehensive export capabilities for security reports

This plan ensures that our API security hardening follows the same evidence-based, question-driven methodology that makes the other frameworks so effective.
