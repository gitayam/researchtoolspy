## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Understanding the Bookmark System

ResearchTools doesn't use traditional accounts. Instead, you get a **bookmark code** - think of it like a library card number that gives you access to your work.

#### Why Bookmark Codes?
- **Complete Privacy**: No email, name, or personal info required
- **Better Security**: No passwords to forget or steal
- **Easy Sharing**: Share codes with colleagues for collaboration
- **No Tracking**: Your research habits remain private

### Step 2: Getting Your Bookmark Code

1. **Visit the registration page**: Go to your ResearchTools site and click "Create Bookmark"
2. **Your code appears**: You'll see a 16-digit code like `1234 5678 9012 3456`
3. **Save it immediately**: This is critical - you cannot recover a lost code
4. **Use a password manager**: Treat it like a Bitcoin private key

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING
- **No recovery possible**: Lost code = lost work forever
- **No support can help**: There's no password reset or account recovery
- **Save multiple copies**: Password manager + secure note + trusted backup

### Step 3: Accessing Your Work

1. Visit the site and click "Access Work"
2. Enter your 16-digit bookmark code
3. Start analyzing!

## üíæ Auto-Save System

Your work saves automatically every 30 seconds to your browser's storage.

### How It Works
- **Local Storage**: Work saves to your browser, not our servers
- **Real-time**: Changes save as you type
- **Offline**: Works without internet connection
- **Private**: Only you can access your saved work

### Important Notes
- **Browser-specific**: Work only appears in the browser where you created it
- **No server backup**: We don't store your work on our servers
- **Clearing browser data**: Will delete your work
- **Private browsing**: Work disappears when session ends

### Best Practices
1. **Export regularly**: Use export features to save outside browser
2. **Multiple browsers**: Consider using different browsers for different projects
3. **Backup important work**: Copy critical analyses to documents
4. **Share for backup**: Share bookmark codes with trusted colleagues

#### "My work disappeared"
- **Cause**: Browser data was cleared or private browsing used
- **Solution**: Check if work exists in different browser
- **Prevention**: Regular exports, avoid private browsing for important work

#### "Sharing isn't working"
- **Check**: Are you sharing the complete 16-digit code?
- **Verify**: Is the person entering code correctly?
- **Format**: Spaces are optional: `1234567890123456` = `1234 5678 9012 3456`

#### "Export failed"
- **Browser**: Try different browser
- **Size**: Large analyses may timeout - try exporting sections
