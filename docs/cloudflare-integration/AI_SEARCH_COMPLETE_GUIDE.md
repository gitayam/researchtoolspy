## 🚀 Quick Start (30 Minutes to Deploy)

### Step 1: Create AI Search Instance (5 min)

```
1. https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. AI → AI Search → Create
3. Name: muse-knowledge-base
4. Data Source: R2 Bucket → Create new → muse-knowledge
5. Create
```

**Verify**: You should see "muse-knowledge-base" in AI Search list

---

### Step 2: Upload Knowledge Base (10 min)

**Option A - Script (Easiest)**:
```bash
cd /Users/sac/Git/Muse_and_Co
./scripts/upload-knowledge-base.sh
```

**Option B - Manual**:
```bash
cd /Users/sac/Git/Muse_and_Co
for file in knowledge-base/**/*.md knowledge-base/**/*.json; do
  npx wrangler r2 object put "muse-knowledge/$file" --file="$file"
done
```

**Verify**:
```bash
npx wrangler r2 object list muse-knowledge
# Should show 11 files
```

---

### Step 3: Wait for Indexing (24-48 hours)

**This is automatic**. Cloudflare will index all uploaded files.

**Check status**:
```bash
npx wrangler ai-search get muse-knowledge-base
```

**Wait for**: `"status": "indexed"`

**Tip**: Check once per day. You'll receive no notification when complete.

---

### Step 4: Test in Playground (5 min)

Once indexed:

```
1. Dashboard → AI Search → muse-knowledge-base → Playground
2. Test queries:
   - "What are your hours?"
   - "Do you have vegan drinks?"
   - "Can I bring my dog?"
```

**Success = Relevant answers with source documents**

---

### Step 5: Deploy Worker (5 min)

```bash
cd /Users/sac/Git/Muse_and_Co

# Deploy enhanced worker
npx wrangler deploy --config wrangler.chatbot.toml

# Verify deployment
npx wrangler deployments list --config wrangler.chatbot.toml
```

**Expected**: Latest deployment shows "Active"

---

### Step 6: Test in Production (5 min)

```bash
# Run automated test suite
./scripts/test-ai-search.sh

# Or manual test
curl https://muse-chatbot.wemea-5ahhf.workers.dev/api/chat \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"do you have vegan drinks?"}'
```

**Look for**: `"source": "ai_search"` in response

---

### Step 7: Monitor (15 min/day, first week)

```bash
# View live logs
npx wrangler tail --config wrangler.chatbot.toml

# Look for:
# ✅ [AI Search] Knowledge query detected
# ✅ [AI Search] Found X relevant results
# ❌ Any errors or warnings
```

**See**: `MONITORING_AND_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` for complete procedures

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Deploying Before Indexing Complete

**Symptom**: AI Search not being used, all queries fallback to OpenAI

**Solution**: Wait for `status: "indexed"` before deploying

**Check**: `npx wrangler ai-search get muse-knowledge-base`

---

### Pitfall 2: Missing R2 Files

**Symptom**: AI Search returns no results

**Solution**: Verify all 11 files uploaded

**Check**: `npx wrangler r2 object list muse-knowledge` (should show 11 files)

---

### Pitfall 3: Wrong Binding Names

**Symptom**: Worker deployment fails with "binding not found"

**Solution**: Verify wrangler.chatbot.toml has correct bindings

**Check**:
```toml
[[ai_search]]
binding = "AI_SEARCH"
name = "muse-knowledge-base"
```

---

### Pitfall 4: Not Monitoring After Deployment

**Symptom**: Issues go unnoticed, user complaints increase

**Solution**: Follow monitoring guide religiously for first week

**Schedule**: 15 min every morning to check logs and metrics

---

## 🆘 Emergency Contacts

### If Something Breaks

**Immediate**: Rollback (3 minutes)
```bash
git checkout v2.4.0-pre-ai-search
npx wrangler deploy --config wrangler.chatbot.toml
```

**See**: `ROLLBACK_GUIDE.md`

---

### If You're Stuck

**Ask Me**:
- "How do I [specific task]?"
- "Why is [something] not working?"
- "What does [error message] mean?"

**Check Docs**: All 6 guides have troubleshooting sections

**Cloudflare Support**: For platform issues (billing, quota, etc.)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Test Locally First

Before deploying to production, test queries in AI Search Playground. Verify responses are accurate.

---

### Tip 2: Start with Conservative Thresholds

Default score threshold (0.75) is good starting point. Lower if too strict, raise if too lenient.

---

### Tip 3: Monitor User Feedback

Add thumbs up/down buttons to chatbot responses. Track which answers users find helpful.

---

### Tip 4: Expand Knowledge Base Gradually

Don't try to cover everything day 1. Add content based on actual user questions.

---

### Tip 5: Use Caching Aggressively

AI Search responses for common questions can be cached for hours. Saves API calls and improves speed.
